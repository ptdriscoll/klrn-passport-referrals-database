Refactor to switch from reliance on video ids to video slugs

Archive all code and the latest database

Replace video table
  Add new id, which automatically increments
  Keep video ids as a regular column
  Add new column in videos table for video slugs
  Refactor database queries and updates to reflect new id and how to find new location of video id
  Run through videos table, call each video in Selenium, grab new slugs and add them to the table

Refactor scraping processes  
  Review where slugs can be found in processes, and change those processes
  Consider whether to still look for video ids, and if so how deep to look
